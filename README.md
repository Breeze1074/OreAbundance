Minecraft necessarily requires mining for resources, especially in the
early game, or for players not inclined to build elaborate farms. This
makes it important to know where in the world is best for finding the
desired ores?

The answer to this question depends on if you are mining in peak biomes
or in other terrain. In peaks we can find coal, copper, emeralds, and
iron are distributed abundantly above sea level. However in other biomes
we find these ores are distributed at different intervals.

For example, in the image below I used data from a fresh minecraft world
using seed 1638586699. I then teleported to various locations with peak
biomes predicted by [Chunk
Base](https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map#1638586699). After loading
more than 1000 chunks of data, I then analyzed block densities by
y-value. It is evident in data heavily biased to mountainous peaks that
the player can find abundant coal, emeralds, and iron at elevation.
Making mountains a lucrative search space for these resources, if the
terrain is plentiful.

## Finding ores outside of mountain biomes

At times, the player may need to access ores from mining the depths of
the world. Thus, I accessed a very large amount of 1.18 data with very
little bias to mountain biomes. This data came from seed 26874156 and is
credited to the patrons of
**[Prowl8413](https://www.youtube.com/c/Prowl8413)** for world
exploration. I tracked ore positions in more than 170,000 chunks with
this data. Looking at combined regular and deepslate ores we can see and
compare distributions of the ores across the world build limit. In
contrast to peaks, here we find that resource acquisition requires
selection of a y-level appropriate for your target ore, or compromised
for a blend of a few ores. For example, this world data suggests mining
around *y = 47* to *y = 43* is best for acquiring coal and copper ores.
Instead, the player should mine at *y = 13* to get the most iron ore.
However, a good compromise can be made by mining around *y = 25* if the
player needs early access to coal and iron both. Diamonds and redstone
ores are easiest to find by mining deep in the world. But another
compromise can be reached around *y = -10* where the player may find
early access to diamonds, gold, iron, lapis, and redstone ores at the
same time.

## The rarest of the rare (time for silk touch)

On the whole, most of the ore types are abundant if the player searches
at the appropriate y-level. There are two exceptions, however: deepslate
coal ore and deepslate emerald ore. Both of these ore types are
exceedingly rare, and on economy servers could replace diamonds as a
high value currency. In the &gt;170,000 chunks of world data from
Prowlâ€™s patron world, deepslate coal ore is only found at *y = -1, -2,
or -3*. Deepslate coal ore can be found throughout the world at this
level range. Deepslate emerald ore can be found more widely distributed,
between *y = -1* to *y \~ -22*. But keep in mind that this ore is
restricted to mountain biomes.
